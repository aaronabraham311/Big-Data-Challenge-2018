Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Flood	Roseau River First Nation, Sioux Falls, Peguis First Nation, St. Andrews, St. Clements and Selkirk MB	24/03/2009 12:00:00 AM	Roseau River First Nation, Sioux Falls, Peguis First Nation, St. Andrews, St. Clements and Selkirk MB, March 24 to May 21, 2009. Overland flooding caused by a combination of snowmelt, seasonal precipitation and the spring breakup affected southern Manitoba's watershed areas of the Red, Pembina, Assiniboine, and Souris Rivers. The event caused flooding of houses and evacuations from communities including Roseau River First Nation, Sioux Falls, Peguis First Nation, St. Andrews, St. Clements and Selkirk. The flooding also resulted in damage to public infrastructure such as bridges, roads, and highways. Three principal factors led to the spring flooding: 1) Heavy autumn rains, about 43 per cent more than normal, saturated the ground just before freezing in early December, which left little room for absorbing snow melt in the spring; 2) It was a snowy winter in southern Manitoba with some 25 per cent more snowfall than normal. Heavy snowfalls and copious spring rains swelled the critical headwaters of North Dakota sending excessive waters north into Canada via the Red River and its tributaries; and, 3) An unseasonably cold spring slowed basin snow melting, ice decaying in rivers, and overland flow from ditches and culverts.	0	0	3000	76506000.0000	85868622.4	21/05/2009 12:00:00 AM	70006000.0000	6500000.0000						0	0.0

Approximately 900 people were evacuated, many from aboriginal comunities including: 250 people from Red Sucker Lake First Nation and 92 people from God's River First Nation were evacuated due to fires that began in July. In August, approximately 155 people were evacuated from Shamattawa while 250 were evacuated from Split Lake. 	0		665	5286253.0000	6602674.0	31/10/2003 12:00:00 AM	5286253.0000							0	0.0	
Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Flood	Southeast MB	11/06/2002 12:00:00 AM	Southeast MB, June 11, 2002. Ten communities declared a state of emergency following severe flooding of homes and roads. About 240 mm of rain fell, causing the worst flooding southeast Manitoba had seen in 45 years. Levels of the Roseau River declined for a few days; however, additional flooding was expected the following week given the record water levels in the American portion of the river and the expected crest in southeast Manitoba. Residents and flood workers built dikes and laid sandbags as a preventative measure in the event of further flooding. Several roads were closed and some of these washed out or were covered with water. Crops were severely damaged because fields were submerged under water, and homes were inundated.	0	0	150	10376248.0000	13323102.4	11/06/2002 12:00:00 AM	3552493.0000	2954305.0000	2094671.0000	1766793.0000			7986.0000	0	0.0

Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Drought	Across Canada, concentrated in Saskatchewan and Alberta	01/06/2001 12:00:00 AM	Across Canada, concentrated in Saskatchewan and Alberta, Spring 2001 to Fall 2002.  A severe drought was felt across all Canada, affecting 41,000 people, with the most devastating impacts felt in Saskatchewan and Alberta.  Record to near-record drought, as indicated by the Palmer Drought Severity Index, was recorded at several climate stations in 2001.  The winter of 2001-2002 continued the dry trend and brought above normal temperatures.  Fall 2002 brought much needed precipitation to relieve much of the drought, though dry conditions did remain in places.  The repercussions of the drought included agricultural production, employment, crop and livestock production, and the Gross Domestic Product.	0	0	0	0.0000	0.0	01/10/2002 12:00:00 AM								0	0.0

The Souris river spread to at least 2 km wide at its peak flooding, and almost topped the makeshift dikes.  The flood washed out roads and damaged bridges in several rural municipalities, and made over 800000 hectares of farmland unseedable this year. Both provincial and federal aid was administered in the form of deadline pushbacks and financial assistance.	0	0	0	109195449.0000	150922450.5	01/04/1999 12:00:00 AM	7292493.0000	3327956.0000	97575000.0000	1000000.0000				0	0.0

Spring runoff and two heavy snowfalls of 20-30 cm each in late March had contributed to the flooding problem.  Public road networks, urban and rural properties and agricultural lands suffered damage. Damage occurred at over 100 locations on the provincial highway system, at over 5500 sites on municipal roads and to large culverts and bridges.  Seventy communities were inundated in Manitoba, including: Roblin, Russell, Binscarth, Birtle, Glenora, Pilot Mound, Melita, Virden, Elkhorn, Boissevain, Springfield, Brandon and Minnedosa.
