Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Winter Storm	Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nove Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland	24/02/2016 12:00:00 AM	Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nove Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland, February 24-26, 2016. A storm system tracked its way northeast into the Great Lakes from the United States in late February. The system moved towards eastern Canada, causing widespread damages to Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland. On February 24, freezing rain caused up to 25 mm of ice accumulation to build in parts of Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick. On February 25, Quebec and New Brunswick experienced several hours of continued freezing rain. Heavy rain and thunderstorms trailed behind the freezing rain resulting in total rainfalls of 51 mm in Hamilton, Ontario, 36 mm in Lennoxville, Quebec and 68 mm in Gray River, Newfoundland. A combination of rain and mild weather that melted ice and snow resulted in localized flooding for numerous communities. Flooded basements were reported in Cornwall, Ontario, multiple underpasses were closed due to flooding in Montreal, Quebec, while local fire departments in northern New Brunswick warned drivers of poor road conditions due to ice ruts and isolated flooding. Multiple local states of emergency were declared in the Eastern Townships of Quebec where ice breakup resulted in the flooding of local rivers. Approximately 200 residents were evacuated and over 50 homes in Beauceville, Quebec were damaged by floodwaters. Fallen trees weighed down by the heavy ice and snow damaged power lines resulting in widespread power outages. Quebec was hit the hardest with over 250,000 hydro customers (approximately 750,000 individuals) affected by the power outages.			200	0.0000	0.0	26/02/2016 12:00:00 AM								750000		
Incident	Conflict	Terrorist	Kidnapping / Murder	Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu QC	20/10/2014 12:00:00 AM	Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu QC, October 20-21, 2014. At approximately 11:30 EDT, assailant Martin Couture-Rouleau deliberately rammed his car into a pair of Canadian Armed Forces soldiers in a parking lot of a local shopping Centre, narrowly missing another soldier and a police officer. Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent was transported to hospital with life-threatening injuries and another un-named soldier sustained non-life threatening injuries. Warrant Officer Vincent succumbed to his injuries the next day in hospital. Martin Couture-Rouleau fled the scene chased by police officers. He eventually lost control of his car and was killed after charging a police officer with a knife. Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the RCMP classified this as a lone-wolf ISIL inspired terrorist attack, unconnected to the shooting on Parliament Hill only two days later.	2	1	0	0.0000	0.0	21/10/2014 12:00:00 AM										
Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Flood	Southern Quebec	14/04/2014 12:00:00 AM	Quebec, April 14 to May 1, 2014. A series of intense rainstorms deposited up to 75 mm of rain throughout parts of southern Quebec over a three-day period. Coupled with a delayed spring thaw, the rain caused ice jams and flooding along several rivers in the province. About 300 residents in Sainte-Raymond evacuated including residents from a senior’s home due to raising water levels in the Sainte-Anne River. Many homes situated near the Montmorency River along with homes in Trois-Rivieres, Lennoxville and Weedon were evacuated. In Sherbrooke 632 residents evacuated their homes as the Saint-Francois River reached a record peak of 7.5 metres.	0	0	1000	13064000.0000	13397904.2	01/05/2014 12:00:00 AM	13064000.0000									
Incident	Technology	Fire	Residential	L’Isle-Verte QC	23/01/2014 12:00:00 AM	L’Isle-Verte QC, January 23 to February 1 , 2014. A fire broke out overnight in the kitchen of the Résidence du Havre nursing home that housed 52 seniors with limited mobility. A combination of a lack of installed sprinklers and the wooden construction of the building contributed to the intensity of the fire. Twenty-eight bodies were recovered during the initial search and another four were classified as missing and presumed dead. There were 15 injuries mostly caused by smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning. In addition, two firefighters were treated for minor injuries. The official Coroner’s report issued February 2015 cited a lack of adequate evacuation and emergency plans, a lack of trained personnel on duty at the facility, and a delay in the firefighter response and backup as factors that contributed to the severity of the disaster. The fire was classified as an accident and no criminal investigation was commenced.	32	15	0	0.0000	0.0	01/02/2014 12:00:00 AM										
Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Winter Storm	Québec	21/12/2013 12:00:00 AM	Québec, December 21-26, 2013. A severe winter storm that formed over the Great Lakes region in Ontario tracked into Québec bringing a mix of freezing rain, ice pellets and snow. The Eastern Townships region of the province was particularly impacted and at its peak, an estimated 51,000 Hydro Québec customers were without power (153,000 individuals). The storm is attributed with the deaths of six people due to a mix of carbon monoxide poisoning and traffic accidents throughout the province.

Incident	Technology	Transportation accident	Rail	Lac-Mégantic QC	06/07/2013 12:00:00 AM	Lac-Mégantic QC, July 6-28, 2013. A 74-car freight train carrying crude oil derailed and exploded in Lac-Mégantic, Quebec. The explosion caused the deaths of 42 people. Five people were not accounted for and were officially listed as having been killed in the explosion. Approximately 2000 people were evacuated from their homes. The explosion destroyed 115 buildings and caused extensive damage to the centre of the town. Over 5,560,000 litres of crude oil was released into the environment and an estimated 100,000 litres spilled into the nearby Chaudière river. The spill travelled down the river and reached the town of Saint-Georges 80 kilometres to the northeast, forcing local authorities to draw water from a nearby lake and install floating barriers to prevent contamination.

Disaster	Natural	Biological	Epidemic	Quebec City	31/07/2012 12:00:00 AM	Quebec City, QC, July 31 to October 10, 2012. The Direction Régionale de Santé Publique de la Capitale-Nationale (DRSP) [Quebec City regional public health authority] reported an outbreak of legionnaires’ disease in Quebec City after it received reports of 13 cases of the disease. According to the Agence de la Santé et des Services Sociaux de la Capitale-Nationale [Quebec City Health and Social Services Agency], the lab analysis of samples taken from the cooling tower at 320 Saint-Joseph Street East identified the specific bacteria that was found in the patients as legionnaires’ disease. On September 18, the same day the results were obtained, the cooling tower fans of this building were shut down by the owner. The outbreak was declared to be over on October 10, after 20 days without a new case, which is twice the incubation period of the disease. In total, 180 people were infected with legionnaires’ disease outbreak, which caused 13 deaths.	13	180	0	0.0000	0.0	10/10/2012 12:00:00 AM	0.0000
