Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Winter Storm	Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island	27/11/2016 12:00:00 AM	Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, November 27-29, 2016. An early winter storm hit the Maritime provinces affecting Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island on November 27. The storm dumped 15 cm of snow on the mainland of Nova Scotia and produced strong winds in Cape Breton. A mix of messy weather consisting of freezing rain, ice and snow created dangerous driving conditions. In Nova Scotia, the Canso Causeway was closed to high-sided vehicles and Highway 104 was closed in certain sections due to poor visibility. One transport truck over turned on the Seal Island Bridge in Cape Breton due to strong wind gusts of up to 110 km/h. In Nova Scotia 11,200 customers (approximately 33,600 individuals) lost power, while in P.E.I 12,000 customers (approximately 36,000 individuals) were without power. In P.E.I power remained out for some residents until November 29.				0.0000	0.0	29/11/2016 12:00:00 AM								69000		
Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Flood	Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland	09/10/2016 12:00:00 AM	Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland, October 9-13, 2016. Atlantic Canada was hit with heavy rain as a result of the remnants of Hurricane Matthew. Wind and heavy rainfall warnings were in affect from October 10 to 11 for northeastern Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. On October 10, 150 mm of rain fell on Newfoundland. The town of Burgeo alone received 120 mm of rain, which caused the closure of Highway 480. St-Alban’s declared a state of emergency due to various road closures including the Swanger’s Cove Bridge on route 361, which was reported to have been damaged and was deemed unusable by the Newfoundland Public Safety Regional Office. Road closures in St-Alban’s resulted in the isolation of numerous homes. In Nova Scotia, over 220 mm of rain was reported across the province. The J.A. Douglas McCurdy Sydney Airport was forced to close all runways. Cape Breton was hard hit by the heavy rain, which resulted in property damage to approximately 300 homes. Most severely impacted was Eskasoni First Nation where 100 homes were flooded and an undetermined number of people evacuated due to high water levels. On October 11, there were 16 states of emergency in Newfoundland where Bager and Gander received 131 mm and 124 mm of rain. While there no states of emergency declared in Nova Scotia, NS Power reported that approximately 130,000 customers (390,000 individuals) had experienced power outages. Prince Edward Island received 73 mm of rain, which left approximately 600 residents without power. Ferries in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland were closed due to eight-metre high waves caused by the storm. The Canadian Armed Forces assisted with sandbagging efforts as water levels continued to rise until October 12. It was not until October 13 when water levels began to drop in certain areas, however in Newfoundland water levels remained at a record high. Power was restored to all customers in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island by October 13.				30350000.0000	30350000.0	13/10/2016 12:00:00 AM	30350000.0000							390600		
Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Winter Storm	Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nove Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland	24/02/2016 12:00:00 AM	Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nove Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland, February 24-26, 2016. A storm system tracked its way northeast into the Great Lakes from the United States in late February. The system moved towards eastern Canada, causing widespread damages to Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland. On February 24, freezing rain caused up to 25 mm of ice accumulation to build in parts of Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick. On February 25, Quebec and New Brunswick experienced several hours of continued freezing rain. Heavy rain and thunderstorms trailed behind the freezing rain resulting in total rainfalls of 51 mm in Hamilton, Ontario, 36 mm in Lennoxville, Quebec and 68 mm in Gray River, Newfoundland. A combination of rain and mild weather that melted ice and snow resulted in localized flooding for numerous communities. Flooded basements were reported in Cornwall, Ontario, multiple underpasses were closed due to flooding in Montreal, Quebec, while local fire departments in northern New Brunswick warned drivers of poor road conditions due to ice ruts and isolated flooding. Multiple local states of emergency were declared in the Eastern Townships of Quebec where ice breakup resulted in the flooding of local rivers. Approximately 200 residents were evacuated and over 50 homes in Beauceville, Quebec were damaged by floodwaters. Fallen trees weighed down by the heavy ice and snow damaged power lines resulting in widespread power outages. Quebec was hit the hardest with over 250,000 hydro customers (approximately 750,000 individuals) affected by the power outages.			200	0.0000	0.0	26/02/2016 12:00:00 AM								750000		
Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Winter Storm	Maritime Provinces	15/02/2015 12:00:00 AM	Maritime Provinces, February 15-17, 2015. A major storm system formed off the United States east coast and moved towards the north Atlantic. On February 15, the storm system hit Nova Scotia bringing with it snow, ice and rain. In Halifax the weather changed from snow to rain, creating flooding in the streets, which turned into an overnight flash freeze. Greenwood, Nova Scotia received 56 cm of snow, while in Cape Breton Island wind gusts were recorded of up to 176 km/h. The next day in New Brunswick, heavy snow impacted Moncton where it snowed up to 58 cm. The hardest hit area was Prince Edward Island where it snowed over 80 cm in Charlottetown. During the storm, damages were caused by strong winds that downed trees and power lines leaving approximately 4000 customers (12,000 individuals) without power in New Brunswick. Flooding brought on by the rain also caused damages to city streets and created dangerous driving conditions as black ice formed when the temperature dropped. The huge amount of snow that fell on the region buried vehicles, left people stranded in their homes and resulted in the closure of numerous schools and businesses. In New Annan, Prince Edward Island 20 people were left homeless in blizzard conditions as fires irrupted in a motel where 18 people had to be evacuated as well as a home near Winsloe where two people had to be evacuated. In addition, an apartment fire in Fredericton resulted in the evacuation of one individual.			21	0.0000	0.0	17/02/2015 12:00:00 AM								12000

Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Winter Storm	Prince Edward Island	13/12/2008 12:00:00 AM	Prince Edward Island, December 13, 2008. An ice storm on December 13, downed 300 utility poles resulting in one of the worst power outages since the mid-1970 and cost Maritime Electric approximately $1.5 million to repair. Nearly 95 per cent of Islanders were without electricity, as freezing rain and an ice pellet-drizzle mix left thick layers of ice on roof tops, trees and transmission lines. Power poles were pulled down by ice-laden lines and strong winds. Across the province, makeshift shelters were organized in legion halls, fire stations, schools and community centres. Rescue teams and hydro crews arrived from outside the province to assist. The Canadian military also remained on standby at the Canadian Forces Base in Gagetown, NB.				0.0000	0.0	13/12/2008 12:00:00 AM								127283
