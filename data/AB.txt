Disaster	Natural	Biological	Epidemic	Alberta and Saskatchewan	26/10/2016 12:00:00 AM	Alberta and Saskatchewan, October 26 to December 21, 2016. In late September, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) discovered a case of bovine tuberculosis (TB) found in a cow from Alberta. The USDA then contacted the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) whom initiated an investigation into the outbreak. The investigation found that one herd of cattle in Alberta was infected with TB. The one infected herd was located on 18 separate properties. Within the infected herd there were six confirmed cases of TB, including the cow that was slaughtered in the United states. The infection resulted in the quarantine of approximately 26,000 cattle from approximately 50 different properties in both Alberta and Saskatchewan. As a precaution, approximately 10,000 cattle were destroyed in order to stop the spread of the infection. The infection significantly impacted farmers in Alberta and Saskatchewan. The federal government of Canada offered to pay up to $16.7 million for ranchers who suffered agricultural loses due to the TB outbreak.				16700000.0000	16700000.0	21/12/2016 12:00:00 AM	16700000.0000

The first wildfire was discovered on April 30, north of Fort McMurray. The Regional Municipality declared a local state of emergency and a mandatory evacuation order for Centennial Park on May 1 as well as another evacuation order for Prairie Creek and Centennial Trailer Park on May 2. The Fort McMurray fire grew rapidly due to hot and dry weather conditions, doubling in size to 2,656 hectares in a manner of hours. On May 3, the wildfire intensified and crossed over Highway 63, cutting off the route to evacuees, prompting the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation to declare a state of local emergency and a mandatory evacuation order for Fort McMurray’s Lower Townsite and downtown area, which included the communities of Gregoire, Beacon Hill, Abasand, Waterways, Draper, Saline Creek, Grayling Terrace, Thickwood, Wood Buffalo and Dickinsfield.

On May 4, the Alberta government declared a provincial state of emergency. The Fort McMurray fire quickly grew to 85,000 hectares as the wildfire spread further north and east eventually passing through Fort McMurray. Evacuees that fled north of Fort McMurray had to be air lifted to safety. Some evacuees were taken to Lac La Biche, while the majority where sent to Edmonton and Calgary. On May 10, two of the main Fort McMurray fires joined together and formed a massive blaze of 229,000 hectares. On May 16, all workers in work camps and oil sand operations north of Fort McMurray were forced to move south as the wildfire spread further north. Residents of Fort McMurray were allowed to return home on June 1. In total, the Fort McMurray fires burned approximately 579,767 hectares of land causing the evacuation of over 90,000 people and destroyed 2,400 homes and business, including 530 other buildings that were damaged. At its peak, there were over 2000 firefighters working the fires daily, including helicopters and water bombers.

Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Drought	Saskatchewan and Alberta	01/03/2009 12:00:00 AM	Saskatchewan and Alberta, March 1 to July 1, 2009.  The Canadian Wheat Board projected lower crop prospects by 20 per cent across the Prairies. A dozen counties and municipal districts in Alberta declared a state of drought emergency or disaster. For example, Saskatoon had less than one-quarter of the usual amount of spring precipitation, making the months of March, April and May the driest since record-keeping began in 1892. It wasn't just spring that was dry. The soil moisture recharge period between September 1, 2008 and March 31, 2009 had less than 60 per cent of normal precipitation. To the west, in Alberta, conditions were even drier, as illustrated by precipitation amounts in Edmonton, where the 12- month total rain and snow from July 2008 to June 2009 was only 234 mm, less than half of normal and the driest such period with records dating back to 1880. Making matters worse, eight of the last ten years in Alberta's capital of Edmonton had less rain and snow than the 30-year average total, but no year was as scanty as the most recent. Not surprisingly, the flow of the North Saskatchewan River was at its third lowest level in nearly a century.	0	0	0	0.0000	0.0	01/07/2009 12:00:00 AM								0	0.0	
Incident	Technology	Hazardous Chemicals	Fire	Zama City AB	15/08/2008 12:00:00 AM	Zama City AB, August 15, 2008. A block of sulphur accidently caught fire when crewmembers were working to dispose of the leftover sulphur from the Aphache Gas Plant near Zama City.  The fire started in the front-end loader, which the crew was using to remove the sulphur. The fire ignited the sulphur payload emitting deadly hydrogen-sulphide gas. Mackenzie County officials declared a state of emergency and ordered an evacuation of the Zama City area, where approximately 250 residents were temporarily evacuated. Three workers were taken to the hospital as a precaution. The evacuation order was lifted after the fire was contained later that day.	0	3	250	0.0000	0.0	15/08/2008 12:00:00 AM								0	0.0
