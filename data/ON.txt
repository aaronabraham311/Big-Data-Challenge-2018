Incident	Conflict	Terrorist	Shootings	Ottawa ON	22/10/2014 12:00:00 AM	Ottawa ON, Oct 22, 2014. At approximately 09:52 EDT, an armed gunman (Michael Zehaf-Bibeau) pulled up in his vehicle to the Ottawa National War Memorial where three Canadian Armed Forces members were posted on Ceremonial Guard sentry duty. Zehaf-Bibeau shot at Cpl. Nathan Cirillo striking him twice in the back and fatally wounding him. Zehaf-Bibeau then fired at the other sentries as he fled towards the Parliament buildings; but neither of the other sentries was struck or injured. Pulling up to Parliament Hill, Zehaf-Bibeau ran from his car and carjacked an idling Parliamentary vehicle on the hill. Members of the RCMP began pursuit as he pulled the vehicle up and ran into the front doors of Parliament. Upon entering, Zefaf-Bibeau engaged in a struggle with House of Commons Security Guard Samearn Son, who was shot in the foot in the ensuing struggle. Zehaf-Bibeau fled further into the Parliament buildings and was fatally shot by the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Commons, Kevin Vickers. In the ensuing search for additional shooters, many federal government buildings and offices were placed in lockdown. Public institutions such as the University of Ottawa and nearby schools were also placed in lockdown. There were false reports that a third shooting had taken place at the Rideau Centre Mall, fueled by high cellular phone and social media usage that also strained cell towers and communications infrastructure. Government employees were asked to restrict their Blackberry usage for emergencies only until the crisis was over to reduce burden on the system. The following day, Prime Minister Stephen Harper classified the attack as terrorism.	2	0	0	0.0000	0.0	22/10/2014 12:00:00 AM										
Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Winter Storm	Southern Ontario	21/12/2013 12:00:00 AM	Southern Ontario, ON, December 21, 2013 to January 1, 2014. A severe storm brought freezing rain and damaging ice accumulation across a large area of southern Ontario. According to Environment Canada, the epicentre of the freezing rain was in southern Ontario along the north shore of Lake Ontario, including the Greater Toronto Area, where ice accumulation reached up to 30 mm. The impact of the ice storm on these municipalities and conservation authorities was further exacerbated by freezing temperatures. The ice storm had serious impacts. In its aftermath, as many as 830,000 hydro customers (2,490,000 individuals) across Southern Ontario were without power for several days. Downed trees, broken branches, and downed wires resulting from ice accumulation posed serious public health and safety risks, as well as transportation network problems. Due to widespread power outages and freezing temperatures, municipalities activated emergency plans to open warming centres and canvassed homes of vulnerable residents to ensure their safety. Power was restored to most residences and businesses by January 1, 2014.
Response and recovery activities began at the time of the event. The ice storm significantly impacted some of Canada’s largest and most densely populated urban municipalities. Municipalities, provincial ministries and non-governmental organizations such as the Red Cross all acted to respond to the ice storm. Ontario determined that the impacts of the storm were severe enough to warrant implementation of an Ice Storm Assistance Program to help municipalities and conservation authorities with emergency response and recovery costs. Two deaths were attributed to the storm due to carbon monoxide poisoning from improperly ventilated generators and heaters.

Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Tornado	Toronto, Windsor, Vaughan and Newmarket ON	20/08/2009 12:00:00 AM	Toronto, Windsor, Vaughan and Newmarket ON, August 20, 2009.  A super cell storm developed just south of Lake Huron and tracked northeastward for a remarkable 200 kilometres. The heat and humidity in Ontario increased once the clouds disappeared. A squall line developed over Lower Michigan and traveled across the Great Lakes reaching southern Ontario at 15:00 EDT. This system produced powerful winds from Windsor to northeast of Toronto as well as destructive tornadoes in Vaughan and Newmarket. While these tornadoes were wreaking havoc just north of Toronto, another series of super cell thunderstorms spawned tornadoes in parts of Simcoe County, Muskoka and Parry Sound Districts to the east of Georgian Bay and north towards Lake Nipissing. In total, the day’s weather produced 19 confirmed tornadoes, including: four F0, eleven F1, and four F2. This was the greatest number of F2 tornadoes in Ontario in one day since the Barrie/central Ontario tornadoes of May 31, 1985. It was also a new Canadian record for the most confirmed tornadoes in one day. Violent winds snapped trees, lifted roofs, flattened cars, mowed down fences, collapsed farm buildings, and inflicted property losses around $100 million. The first tornado of the day touched down in the town of Durham in Grey County, killing a young boy as he left a nearby conservation area day camp. About 600 homes, mostly in the communities of Maple and Woodbridge were damaged. Fourty were destroyed and declared unsafe. At the peak of the storm, Hydro One reported that 69,000 customers (approximately 207,000 individuals) had lost power.	1	0	0	0.0000	0.0	20/08/2009 12:00:00 AM								207000	0.0	
Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Storms and Severe Thunderstorms	Hamilton and Toronto ON	26/07/2009 12:00:00 AM	Hamilton and Toronto ON, July 26, 2009. A storm cell stalled over the western end of Lake Ontario. Hamilton was hard hit. Waves of thunderstorms pounded the city, leaving citizens with flooded basements and motorists stuck in traffic caused by road closures. The midday downpour turned Red Hill Creek into an angry brown torrent that forced the closure of nearby roads and highways. Water gushed into 7000 basements and power was shut off to thousands of customers. While the Hamilton Airport observed only 28 mm of rain, radar estimates confirmed rainfall amounts in an unofficial gauge totaling 110 mm in two hours - worse than a 100-year storm and one of the most intense short-duration rainfalls on record in Canada. Conditions were made worse because the ground was super-saturated from storms two days earlier. In Toronto, parts of Lakeshore Boulevard near the Exhibition grounds were submerged. To the north, a pair of giant sinkholes swallowed part of Finch Avenue West - big enough to hold a fleet of cars and deep enough to cover a four-storey building.	0	0	0	0.0000	0.0	26/07/2009 12:00:00 AM								0	0.0

Incident	Technology	Transportation accident	Vehicle	Windsor ON	03/09/1999 12:00:00 AM	Windsor ON, September 3, 1999.  Dense fog and high speed are blamed for a massive car pileup/accident on Hwy. 401 near Windsor. At least 40 vehicles collided, including transport trucks, vans and cars, resulting in seven deaths and 33 injuries.  The intensity of the fire, which caused the road's asphalt to melt, and the fire damage, which destroyed many of the vehicles, made it impossible to fully understand how the collisions occurred.  At least five separate accidents occurred, blocking both sides of the highway.	7	33	0			03/09/1999 12:00:00 AM	0.0000	0.0000						0	0.0
