Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Winter Storm	Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nove Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland	24/02/2016 12:00:00 AM	Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nove Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland, February 24-26, 2016. A storm system tracked its way northeast into the Great Lakes from the United States in late February. The system moved towards eastern Canada, causing widespread damages to Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland. On February 24, freezing rain caused up to 25 mm of ice accumulation to build in parts of Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick. On February 25, Quebec and New Brunswick experienced several hours of continued freezing rain. Heavy rain and thunderstorms trailed behind the freezing rain resulting in total rainfalls of 51 mm in Hamilton, Ontario, 36 mm in Lennoxville, Quebec and 68 mm in Gray River, Newfoundland. A combination of rain and mild weather that melted ice and snow resulted in localized flooding for numerous communities. Flooded basements were reported in Cornwall, Ontario, multiple underpasses were closed due to flooding in Montreal, Quebec, while local fire departments in northern New Brunswick warned drivers of poor road conditions due to ice ruts and isolated flooding. Multiple local states of emergency were declared in the Eastern Townships of Quebec where ice breakup resulted in the flooding of local rivers. Approximately 200 residents were evacuated and over 50 homes in Beauceville, Quebec were damaged by floodwaters. Fallen trees weighed down by the heavy ice and snow damaged power lines resulting in widespread power outages. Quebec was hit the hardest with over 250,000 hydro customers (approximately 750,000 individuals) affected by the power outages.			200	0.0000	0.0	26/02/2016 12:00:00 AM								750000

Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Flood	Perth-Andover NB	18/04/2015 12:00:00 AM	Perth-Andover NB, April 18-20, 2015. Perth-Andover experienced significant flooding due to a massive ice jam that broke apart on the St. John and Tobique Rivers. Ice congested local waterways near the village of Perth-Andover causing water levels to rise. The flooding forced 300 people to evacuate. The Canadian Red Cross assisted with the evacuation order. Many businesses closed down, including schools and the local hospital where 23 patients staying at the Hotel Dieu of St. Joseph had to be relocated. Route 105, the major road into Perth-Andover, was closed due to the risk of overland flooding.			300	0.0000	0.0	20/04/2015 12:00:00 AM										
Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Winter Storm	Maritime Provinces	15/02/2015 12:00:00 AM	Maritime Provinces, February 15-17, 2015. A major storm system formed off the United States east coast and moved towards the north Atlantic. On February 15, the storm system hit Nova Scotia bringing with it snow, ice and rain. In Halifax the weather changed from snow to rain, creating flooding in the streets, which turned into an overnight flash freeze. Greenwood, Nova Scotia received 56 cm of snow, while in Cape Breton Island wind gusts were recorded of up to 176 km/h. The next day in New Brunswick, heavy snow impacted Moncton where it snowed up to 58 cm. The hardest hit area was Prince Edward Island where it snowed over 80 cm in Charlottetown. During the storm, damages were caused by strong winds that downed trees and power lines leaving approximately 4000 customers (12,000 individuals) without power in New Brunswick. Flooding brought on by the rain also caused damages to city streets and created dangerous driving conditions as black ice formed when the temperature dropped. The huge amount of snow that fell on the region buried vehicles, left people stranded in their homes and resulted in the closure of numerous schools and businesses. In New Annan, Prince Edward Island 20 people were left homeless in blizzard conditions as fires irrupted in a motel where 18 people had to be evacuated as well as a home near Winsloe where two people had to be evacuated. In addition, an apartment fire in Fredericton resulted in the evacuation of one individual.			21	0.0000	0.0	17/02/2015 12:00:00 AM								12000

A severe winter storm system that formed over the Great Lakes Region caused significant damage in Ontario and Quebec before moving east bringing freezing rain, ice pellets, and snow to New Brunswick. Starting December 20, southern Ontario received 20-30 mm of freezing rain during a two-day period. In Quebec, 53,000 people lost power due to the freezing rain, which damaged power lines. By December 23, over 54,000 NB Power customers were without power. A second storm tracked north along the Atlantic coast, bringing up to 30 cm of snow, causing more power outages and delays, which complicated recovery efforts. In total, over 88,000 NB Power customers (approximately 264,000 individuals) lost power over an 11-day period, with the last restorations occurring on January 3, 2014. In total, 11 individuals died during the ice storm from either vehicle accidents or carbon monoxide poisoning from the use of gas generators.	0	0	0	0.0000	0.0	03/01/2014 12:00:00 AM								317000		
Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Flood	Perth-Andover NB	23/03/2012 12:00:00 AM	Perth-Andover NB, March 23-25, 2012.

Public Safety Canada’s regional office reported that approximately 200 homes and businesses were damaged, including those of the Tobique First Nation. The province’s Emergency Measures Organization indicated that unseasonably hot weather caused rapid snowmelt, resulting in an ice jam that was to blame for the river breaching its banks. Andover Elementary School and Southern Victoria High School were both closed due to damages from the floodwaters. The Red Cross used Perth-Andover Middle School as an emergency evacuation site. Perth-Andover hospital also sustained damages; patients were relocated to the Upper River Valley Hospital in Waterville and Grand Falls General Hospital, while some were discharged home. Service New Brunswick’s temporary location in Perth-Andover offered free well-water bacterial testing for private well owners who were impacted by the flood. Health Canada was responsible for contacting well owners with information on potentially harmful contamination in their water, whereas Environment Canada as well as local authorities were responsible for notifying remaining well owners of the absence of bacteria in their water. New Brunswick’s provincial government offered information on government services for people whose property sustained damage resulting from the flood. The response level remained within provincial capacity.			500	19778000.0000	20866846.3	25/03/2012 12:00:00 AM	19778000.0000
