Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Winter Storm	Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nove Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland	24/02/2016 12:00:00 AM	Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nove Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland, February 24-26, 2016. A storm system tracked its way northeast into the Great Lakes from the United States in late February. The system moved towards eastern Canada, causing widespread damages to Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland. On February 24, freezing rain caused up to 25 mm of ice accumulation to build in parts of Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick. On February 25, Quebec and New Brunswick experienced several hours of continued freezing rain. Heavy rain and thunderstorms trailed behind the freezing rain resulting in total rainfalls of 51 mm in Hamilton, Ontario, 36 mm in Lennoxville, Quebec and 68 mm in Gray River, Newfoundland. A combination of rain and mild weather that melted ice and snow resulted in localized flooding for numerous communities. Flooded basements were reported in Cornwall, Ontario, multiple underpasses were closed due to flooding in Montreal, Quebec, while local fire departments in northern New Brunswick warned drivers of poor road conditions due to ice ruts and isolated flooding. Multiple local states of emergency were declared in the Eastern Townships of Quebec where ice breakup resulted in the flooding of local rivers. Approximately 200 residents were evacuated and over 50 homes in Beauceville, Quebec were damaged by floodwaters. Fallen trees weighed down by the heavy ice and snow damaged power lines resulting in widespread power outages. Quebec was hit the hardest with over 250,000 hydro customers (approximately 750,000 individuals) affected by the power outages.			200	0.0000	0.0	26/02/2016 12:00:00 AM								750000

Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Winter Storm	Maritime Provinces	15/02/2015 12:00:00 AM	Maritime Provinces, February 15-17, 2015. A major storm system formed off the United States east coast and moved towards the north Atlantic. On February 15, the storm system hit Nova Scotia bringing with it snow, ice and rain. In Halifax the weather changed from snow to rain, creating flooding in the streets, which turned into an overnight flash freeze. Greenwood, Nova Scotia received 56 cm of snow, while in Cape Breton Island wind gusts were recorded of up to 176 km/h. The next day in New Brunswick, heavy snow impacted Moncton where it snowed up to 58 cm. The hardest hit area was Prince Edward Island where it snowed over 80 cm in Charlottetown. During the storm, damages were caused by strong winds that downed trees and power lines leaving approximately 4000 customers (12,000 individuals) without power in New Brunswick. Flooding brought on by the rain also caused damages to city streets and created dangerous driving conditions as black ice formed when the temperature dropped. The huge amount of snow that fell on the region buried vehicles, left people stranded in their homes and resulted in the closure of numerous schools and businesses. In New Annan, Prince Edward Island 20 people were left homeless in blizzard conditions as fires irrupted in a motel where 18 people had to be evacuated as well as a home near Winsloe where two people had to be evacuated. In addition, an apartment fire in Fredericton resulted in the evacuation of one individual.			21	0.0000	0.0	17/02/2015 12:00:00 AM								12000
