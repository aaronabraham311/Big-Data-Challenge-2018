Disaster	Natural	Biological	Epidemic	Alberta and Saskatchewan	26/10/2016 12:00:00 AM	Alberta and Saskatchewan, October 26 to December 21, 2016. In late September, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) discovered a case of bovine tuberculosis (TB) found in a cow from Alberta. The USDA then contacted the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) whom initiated an investigation into the outbreak. The investigation found that one herd of cattle in Alberta was infected with TB. The one infected herd was located on 18 separate properties. Within the infected herd there were six confirmed cases of TB, including the cow that was slaughtered in the United states. The infection resulted in the quarantine of approximately 26,000 cattle from approximately 50 different properties in both Alberta and Saskatchewan. As a precaution, approximately 10,000 cattle were destroyed in order to stop the spread of the infection. The infection significantly impacted farmers in Alberta and Saskatchewan. The federal government of Canada offered to pay up to $16.7 million for ranchers who suffered agricultural loses due to the TB outbreak.				16700000.0000	16700000.0	21/12/2016 12:00:00 AM	16700000.0000									
Incident	Technology	Hazardous Chemicals	Leak / Spill Release	North Saskatchewan River SK	21/07/2016 12:00:00 AM	North Saskatchewan River SK, July 21, 2016. A pipeline from Husky Energy Inc. ruptured spilling up to 250,000 litres of oil mixed with diluent into the North Saskatchewan River. Signs of the leak were first detected on July 20, however after an initial inspection crews reported that no leak was found. The next day the pipeline was shut off as a precaution, after a few hours oil was spotted in the river and an emergency response team was dispatched. The leak that spread hundreds of kilometres downstream contaminated the waterways of the North Saskatchewan River, which is the primary water source for many communities. On July 23 and 25, the contaminated water reached North Battleford and Prince Albert, where a state of emergency was declared, causing both communities to shut off their water supply intake. In addition, the city of Melfort and the town of Star City were put on a boil-water advisory. Multiple First Nation communities were affected including Muskaday First Nation, which declared a state of local emergency on July 27. As of July 29, oil ceased to be released from the source site and the spill was 40-50 per cent recovered. The spill caused severe environmental damages and clean-up efforts ran the risk of disrupting approximately 3000 archaeological sites located along the waterways.				0.0000	0.0	21/07/2016 12:00:00 AM

Severe thunderstorms affected the southern Alberta region before moving into Saskatchewan. A storm system southwest of Calgary produced a small tornado that touched down in the Tsuu T’ina Nation at 12:53 MTZ as well as multiple funnel clouds, which were spotted in the Calgary area. The impact of the tornado was minimal, however the proximity of the tornado to a highly populated area like Calgary created an extremely high level of risk. Southern areas of Calgary including Canyon Meadows and Lake Bonavista were hit with large hail and as the storm moved east, Hussar, Patricia and Strathmore were impacted by strong wind gusts that downed trees over power lines resulting in localized power outages. A severe thunderstorm warning was in effect at the time meaning that wind gusts exceeded 90 km/h and hail was greater than two cm. The storm later reached Saskatchewan where the town of Kerrobert was hit with severe hail, prompting a state of emergency to be declared. Other communities in Saskatchewan such as Anglin Lake, Francis, Sedley and Regina were impacted by strong winds, heavy rain, hail and lighting. Golf-ball sized hail caused the most significant damages during the storm, including damages to roofs, windows and vehicles.				0.0000	0.0	22/07/2015 12:00:00 AM

The Canadian Wheat Board projected lower crop prospects by 20 per cent across the Prairies. A dozen counties and municipal districts in Alberta declared a state of drought emergency or disaster. For example, Saskatoon had less than one-quarter of the usual amount of spring precipitation, making the months of March, April and May the driest since record-keeping began in 1892. It wasn't just spring that was dry. The soil moisture recharge period between September 1, 2008 and March 31, 2009 had less than 60 per cent of normal precipitation. To the west, in Alberta, conditions were even drier, as illustrated by precipitation amounts in Edmonton, where the 12- month total rain and snow from July 2008 to June 2009 was only 234 mm, less than half of normal and the driest such period with records dating back to 1880. Making matters worse, eight of the last ten years in Alberta's capital of Edmonton had less rain and snow than the 30-year average total, but no year was as scanty as the most recent. Not surprisingly, the flow of the North Saskatchewan River was at its third lowest level in nearly a century.	0	0	0	0.0000	0.0	01/07/2009 12:00:00 AM								0	0.0
