Incident	Technology	Hazardous Chemicals	Leak / Spill Release	Seaforth Channel BC	13/10/2016 12:00:00 AM	Seaforth Channel BC, October 13, 2016. The articulated barge and tug, Nathan E. Stewart, ran aground near Bella Bella in the Seaforth Channel. The tug, which contained 215,000 litres of diesel, began taking on water resulting in the empty barge breaking free from the tug. The tug was partially submerged and two of its fuel tanks were breached causing fuel to leak into the waters off the coast of the Great Bear Rainforest. The barge and tug, which were owned by the U.S. company Kirby Offshore Marine, were travelling south from Alaska. On October 14, two aerial flights confirmed that the sheen had spread throughout the Gale passage. Protection and containment efforts consisted of absorbent booms that were deployed around the damaged tug and booming along the Gale Passage, which included the application of petroleum sorbent. A dive team partially repaired sections of the breached fuel tanks to reduce the leakage while workers attempted to pump out the remaining fuel inside. Clean up and salvage recovery efforts were hindered by bad weather. It was not until November 15 when the tug was finally lifted out of the water and taken to shore on a salvage barge. It is estimated that 108,000 litres of fuel and 2,240 litres of lubricants were spilled. Most impacted by the leak was the Heiltsuk First Nation who closed local clam fisheries due to environmental concerns.				0.0000	0.0	13/10/2016 12:00:00 AM

Several beaches were closed and residents were instructed not to come in contact with the toxic oil. The leak was relatively small but had a significant negative impact on the water quality, local wildlife and environment. According to researchers of the Vancouver Aquarium Marine Science Centre Ocean Pollution Research Program, sediment samples collected from the sites of Second Beach and English Bay exceeded Canadian environmental quality guidelines for aquatic life conservation.				0.0000	0.0	08/04/2015 12:00:00 AM										
Incident	Technology	Infrastructure failure	Manufacturing / Industry	Quesnel Lake BC	04/08/2014 12:00:00 AM	Quesnel Lake BC, August 4-12, 2014. The dam for the tailings pond at the Imperial Metals Mount Polley copper and gold mine breached; releasing nearly 10 million cubic metres of water and 4.5 million cubic metres of contaminated slurry into nearby Polley Lake, Hazeltine Creek, Cariboo Creek and Quesnel Lake. On August 6, the Cariboo Regional District declared a local state of emergency in several nearby communities due to concerns over the quality of drinking water, affecting over 300 residents. By August 12, the BC Government lifted the ban on drinking water for many homes with the exception of those within 100 metres of the sediment deposit. A final report commissioned by the BC Government attributed the dam failure to a design flaw, where the foundation was built upon unstable glacial till, exacerbated by the dam being repeatedly raised and expanded.	0	0	0	0.0000	0.0	12/08/2014 12:00:00 AM								300

Disaster	Natural	Geological	Landslide	Khyex River BC	28/11/2003 12:00:00 AM	Khyex River BC, November 28, 2003. The Khyex River Landslide occurred on November 28, between 00:20 and 00:30 PST. This is when Pacific Northern Gas Ltd noticed a pressure loss in the pipeline. Approximately 300 metres of 8-inch pipeline was lost. As a result, most of Prince Rupert residents were without natural gas or heat for 10 days. A few days after the landslide occurred, a temporary 2-inch gas line was installed to restore partial service. The spectacular landslide flowed downstream, crossed the river and flowed upstream for hundreds of metres. This type of landslide took place in very sensitive glaciomarine muds, and is called a retrogressive earthflow. The estimated volume of material displaced by the landslide is up to 4.7 million cubic metres. It is thought that the slope failure was triggered by erosion of the riverbank.	0	0	0	0.0000	0.0	28/11/2003 12:00:00 AM	0.0000	0.0000						0	0.0
